Dataset Overview
This dataset contains information about bookings made at two types of hotels: resort hotels and city hotels. The dataset includes data on various aspects of the bookings, such as booking dates, lengths of stays, customer demographics, and booking modifications.

The dataset can be used for various analyses, such as studying booking patterns, customer preferences, and cancellation rates. It may also be useful for building models to predict cancellations or to recommend rooms and services to guests.

Exploratory Data Analysis Suggestions
Here are some ideas for EDA with the hotel booking dataset:

Cancellation Analysis: Explore patterns and trends in booking cancellations. Investigate how cancellation rates vary based on different features such as hotel type, lead time, room type, and booking changes.

Booking Trends: Analyze booking trends over time (e.g., by year, month, or week). Identify seasonal patterns in bookings and how they vary for different hotel types.

Customer Demographics: Investigate the demographics of customers, such as the distribution of the number of adults, children, and babies across different types of bookings.

Room Types: Examine the most common room types reserved and assigned, as well as any discrepancies between them. Determine how room types impact ADR (average daily rate).

Market Segments and Distribution Channels: Explore the distribution of market segments and booking channels used. Identify patterns in how customers book hotels.

Special Requests and Parking: Analyze the frequency and types of special requests made by customers, as well as the demand for car parking spaces.
